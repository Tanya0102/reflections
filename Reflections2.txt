QUESTION:

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The git init command creates a new Git repository. 
It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.
Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.
Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory, which contains all of the necessary Git metadata for the new repository. 
This metadata includes subdirectories for objects, refs, and template files.

QUESTION:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intemdiate are between the working directory and the repository. To commit files in the repository such that there is a commit 
per logical change, the staging area is used. The staging area allows us to add sets of logically related files one at a time  so that it is easier to 
keep track of a logical change for each commit.
